# MQTT/Node base home alarm system

This is a port of the [HomeAlarm](https://github.com/mhdawson/HomeAlarm) project
over to the micro-app framwork so that you can get the native
look and feel on desktop and mobile devices with the
[micro-app-cordova-launcher](https://github.com/mhdawson/micro-app-cordova-launcher)
and [micro-app-electron-launcher](https://github.com/mhdawson/micro-app-electron-launcher)
projects.

This projects provides a home based alarm system using Node and
MQTT. It provides a GUI that allows you to:

* arm/disarm the alarm
* see the status of the zones
* ask that a picture be taken
* view the last 4 pictures taken
* view pictures from multiple cameras
* view the log of alarm events

When the alarm is triggered it will take pictures every 10 second for 5 minutes, pushing them to a remote webserver.
It can also be configured to send sms messages to notify the owner than an alarm has occured.

In a browser:

Native application:

On a phone:

The following projects can be used to connect sensors such
motion detectors, door contacts and webcams.
* [PI433WirelessRecvMananager](https://github.com/mhdawson/PI433WirelessRecvManager) 
  or this less expensive project
  [Mqtt433Bridge](https://github.com/mhdawson/arduino-esp8266/tree/master/Mqtt433Bridge).
  
* [PIWebcamServer](https://github.com/mhdawson/PIWebcamServer)

Additional views when alarm is active and triggered

View when using GUI to display pictures taken by camera

The server requires Node along with the modules defined in the package.json
file to be installed.
 
It also requires:

* an mqtt server 
* a remote webserver to serve up the pictures taken
* twillio account (If you want SMS notifications)

# Configuration

Most configuration is done in the config.json file which supports the
following configuration options:

* title - title used to name the page for the app
* alarmSite - Name assigned to this instance of the alarm
* serverPort - port on which micro-app is listening for connections
* tls - set to the string "true" if you want to force tls when connecting
* authenticate - set to "true" to enable basic authentication. If set
  to true then you must provide the "authInfo" values described below
* scrollBars - set this to "true" so that you can scroll when viweing the log
  file
* authInfo - object with username, password and realm values. authInfo.password is
  the hashed password that will be used to authenticate to the micro-app.
  This can be generated with the utility in the micro-app framework which
  is called: .../node_modules/micro-app-framework/lib/gen_password.js.
  The first parameter is the password to be hashed.
* mqtt - object with serverUrl, rootTopic and certsDir.  If the serverUrl
  uses tls (ex mqtts: then certsDir must contain the required certificates
  etc. needed to connect to the mqtt server using tls)
* zone - array objects, each of which specifies the topic, zoneId and label
  for one of the alarm zones
* twilio - object specifying the accountSID, accountAuthToken, fromNumber 
  and toNumber that will be used to send SMS notifications
* camera - object with topic used to communicate with the camera server
  and topics and messages used to communicate with an IR illuminator (see
  https://github.com/mhdawson/PI433WirelessTXManager for the circuit
  used to turn on/off the power supply for the IR illuminator)
* eventLogPrefix - directory in which log for alarm will be written

For example this is my configuration file with some key elements

# Installation

The easiest way to install is to run:

<PRE>
npm install micro-app-home-alarm
</PRE>

and then configure the default config.json file in the lib directory as described
in the configuration section above.

# Running

Simply cd to the directory where the npm was installed and type:

<PRE>
npm start
</PRE>

## TODOs
- Add more doc on how to configure, setup and run, including the required mqtt server
